========================

[![MIT licensed][mit-badge]][mit-link]

Installs and configures the IBM Spectrum Protect (formally Tivoli Storage Manager) backup client on Ubuntu Linux


Requirements
------------

An IBM Spectrum Protect (TSM) server must be available to connect to. The server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN), communication method (typically TCP/IP), and port will be needed.


Role Variables
--------------

The following variables are available with defaults defined in `defaults/main.yml`:

The url to download the client tarball from IBM. This value is further defined based on the operating system of the host and only needs to be specified if you want a different version.

    tsmbackup_client_url: ""


Specify the directories to be backed up.

    tsmbackup_backup_dirs: []


Use the following to backup all files on the host.

```yaml
tsmbackup_backup_dirs:
  - all-local
```


Specify the files/directories to exclude.

```yaml
tsmbackup_exclusion_files:
  - "/etc/shadow"
tsmbackup_exclusion_dirs:
  - "/proc"
```


The backup is scheduled to run using a Cron task.

Specify who receives the email generated by Cron.

    tsmbackup_run_mailto: "root"

Customize when that backup runs. The default is every day at 6am.

    tsmbackup_run_hour: 6
    tsmbackup_run_min: 0
    tsmbackup_run_month: "*"
    tsmbackup_run_day: "*"
    tsmbackup_run_days: "*"

Optionally disable the cron job (i.e., comment it out) by setting this to "no". The default is "yes".

    tsmbackup_run_enable: yes

Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the client (host where this is being installed) to identify it to the server.

    tsmbackup_nodename: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"


Username of the user accessing the server on behalf of the client.

    tsmbackup_user: "{{ devops_user|default(ansible_user) }}"


Specify the TSM backup server and how to connect to it.

    tsmbackup_server: ""
    tsmbackup_server_comm_method: TCPip


Optionally specify the TSM backup server's port. The default ports of 1500 for optional SSL connections or 1542 for required SSL connections will be used if no port is specified.

    tsmbackup_server_port: 1500


Enable SSL communication with the TSM backup server.

    tsmbackup_ssl: no

In addition to turning on the use of SSL, if a CA certificate needs to be installed for the TSM backup server's SSL certificate, specify the following values.

```yaml
# the name of the CA certificate being installed
tsmbackup_ssl_server: ""
# the file containing the CA certificate
tsmbackup_ssl_file: ""
# the url to download the CA certificate from
tsmbackup_ssl_url: ""

# example of how these values are used
# wget {{ tsmbackup_ssl_url }}
# sudo dsmcert -add -server {{ tsmbackup_ssl_server }} -file {{ tsmbackup_ssl_file }}
```

Specify whether to continue compressing files even if their size increases through the use of compression. (TSM defaults to Yes)

    tsmbackup_compress_always: "No"


Specify if symlinks should be followed and the target is backed up (Yes) or if just the symbolic link is backed up (No). Valid with the "archive" command ONLY!

    tsmbackup_archive_symlink_as_file: "No"


Specify if symlinks should be followed during incremental backups and if files should be restored to the target of the symlink. (TSM defaults to No) Valid with the "incremental", "restore", and "retrieve" commands.

    tsmbackup_follow_symlinks: "Yes"


The log files for the scheduler and errors.

    tsmbackup_scheduler_log: "/var/log/dsmsched.log"
    tsmbackup_error_log: "/var/log/dsmerror.log"


Dependencies
------------

None.
